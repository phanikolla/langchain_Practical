# 🚀 LangChain Practical Learning Journey

Welcome to my LangChain learning repository! This project showcases my practical exploration of LangChain's powerful features for building advanced language model applications.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and examples of various LangChain features, demonstrating how to build sophisticated AI applications using LangChain's powerful framework. Each implementation includes detailed examples, best practices, and real-world use cases.

## 🛠️ Current Implementations

### 1. Function Calling
- Implementation of OpenAI's function calling capabilities
- Practical examples of how to structure and use function calls with LLMs
- Real-world use cases and best practices
- Integration with custom functions and tools
- Error handling and validation patterns

### 2. LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Hands-on examples of LCEL implementation
- Understanding the power of composable chains
- Building complex workflows with simple, readable code
- Chain composition and transformation
- Input/output processing patterns

### 3. Tagging and Extraction
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) implementation
- Information extraction from unstructured text
- Custom tagging implementations
- Pattern matching and classification
- Data validation and cleaning
- Integration with various data sources
