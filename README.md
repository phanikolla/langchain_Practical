# 🚀 LangChain Practical Learning Journey

Welcome to my LangChain learning repository! This project showcases my practical exploration of LangChain's powerful features for building advanced language model applications.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and examples of various LangChain features, demonstrating how to build sophisticated AI applications using LangChain's powerful framework.

## 🛠️ Current Implementations

### 1. Function Calling
- Implementation of OpenAI's function calling capabilities
- Practical examples of how to structure and use function calls with LLMs
- Real-world use cases and best practices

### 2. LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Hands-on examples of LCEL implementation
- Understanding the power of composable chains
- Building complex workflows with simple, readable code

### 3. Tagging and Extraction
- Named Entity Recognition implementation
- Information extraction from text
- Custom tagging implementations

### 4. Tools and Routing
- Custom tool creation and implementation
- Dynamic routing between different chains
- Tool selection and execution

### 5. Conversational Agent
- Building interactive agents
- Memory management
- Context-aware conversations
