# 🚀 LangChain Practical Learning Journey

Welcome to my LangChain learning repository! This project showcases my practical exploration of LangChain's powerful features for building advanced language model applications.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and examples of various LangChain features, demonstrating how to build sophisticated AI applications using LangChain's powerful framework.

## 🛠️ Current Implementations

### 1. Function Calling
- Implementation of OpenAI's function calling capabilities
- Practical examples of how to structure and use function calls with LLMs
- Real-world use cases and best practices

### 2. LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Hands-on examples of LCEL implementation
- Understanding the power of composable chains
- Building complex workflows with simple, readable code

## 🎯 Upcoming Features

The following features are planned for future implementation:

- **Tagging and Extraction**
  - Named Entity Recognition
  - Information extraction from text
  - Custom tagging implementations

- **Tools and Routing**
  - Custom tool creation
  - Dynamic routing between different chains
  - Tool selection and execution

- **Conversational Agent**
  - Building interactive agents
  - Memory management
  - Context-aware conversations
